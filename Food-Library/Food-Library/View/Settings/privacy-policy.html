    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 25.12.2024</p>

    <p>At <strong>Food-Library</strong> ("we," "our," or "us"), we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information you share with us when using our mobile application <strong>Food-Library</strong> (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

    <p>By using our App, you agree to the collection and use of your information as outlined in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personal information directly from you when using the App. The only data we collect is through the use of third-party services, such as Firebase, for performance and functionality improvements.</p>

    <h4>1.1 Firebase Analytics and Services</h4>
    <p>We use <strong>Firebase</strong>, a third-party service provided by Google, to collect and analyze certain non-personal information. Firebase may collect the following types of data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Firebase may collect information about the device you use to access the App, such as the device type, operating system version, and unique device identifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Firebase collects anonymous data on how you interact with the App, such as usage patterns, feature interactions, screen views, and the duration of App sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Crash and Error Data:</strong> Firebase Crashlytics collects data on crashes or errors within the App to help us improve its performance and fix bugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>1.2 No Collection of Personal Information</h4>
    <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, email address, or any other information that could identify you, unless you voluntarily provide it (e.g., through a support request or feedback form). However, we strongly recommend that you avoid sharing any personal information via the App unless absolutely necessary.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the data collected by Firebase for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>App Functionality and Performance:</strong> We use data to monitor and enhance the performance and stability of the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Analysis:</strong> Firebase analytics helps us understand how the App is being used, which features are most popular, and how we can improve the user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Bug Fixes and App Improvements:</strong> Crash data helps us identify and resolve errors or crashes, improving the App’s overall stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain the information collected through Firebase for as long as necessary to provide and improve the App. We do not store any personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily share it with us through support channels.</p>

    <h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. The information collected by Firebase is used solely for the purposes described above.</p>
    <p>We may share data with third-party service providers like Firebase, but only in accordance with their privacy policies. Firebase’s use of data is governed by their own privacy policies, which you can read <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>We may also disclose your information if required by law, such as in response to a court order or governmental request.</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we discover that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.</p>

    <h2>6. Security of Your Information</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect the security of your data, but please note that no method of electronic storage or transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We use industry-standard security measures, such as encryption, to protect the data transmitted between your device and the App.</p>
    <p>However, we cannot guarantee complete security, and you are responsible for maintaining the security of your own device.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the revised policy on this page and update the effective date at the top. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights with respect to your personal data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can request a copy of the data we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Correction:</strong> You can request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete information.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can request that we delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Objection to Processing:</strong> You can object to the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.</li>
