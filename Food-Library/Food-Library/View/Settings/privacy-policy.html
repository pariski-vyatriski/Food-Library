    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 25.12.2024</p>

    <p>At <strong>Food-Library</strong> ("we," "our," or "us"), we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information you share with us when using our mobile application <strong>Food-Library</strong> (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

    <p>By using our App, you agree to the collection and use of your information as outlined in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personal information directly from you when using the App. The only data we collect is through the use of third-party services, such as Firebase, for performance and functionality improvements.</p>

    <h4>1.1 Firebase Analytics and Services</h4>
    <p>We use <strong>Firebase</strong>, a third-party service provided by Google, to collect and analyze certain non-personal information. Firebase may collect the following types of data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Firebase may collect information about the device you use to access the App, such as the device type, operating system version, and unique device identifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Firebase collects anonymous data on how you interact with the App, such as usage patterns, feature interactions, screen views, and the duration of App sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Crash and Error Data:</strong> Firebase Crashlytics collects data on crashes or errors within the App to help us improve its performance and fix bugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>1.2 No Collection of Personal Information</h4>
    <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, email address, or any other information that could identify you, unless you voluntarily provide it (e.g., through a support request or feedback form). However, we strongly recommend that you avoid sharing any personal information via the App unless absolutely necessary.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the data collected by Firebase for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>App Functionality and Performance:</strong> We use data to monitor and enhance the performance and stability of the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Analysis:</strong> Firebase analytics helps us understand how the App is being used, which features are most popular, and how we can improve the user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Bug Fixes and App Improvements:</strong> Crash data helps us identify and resolve errors or crashes, improving the App’s overall stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. The information collected by Firebase is used solely for the purposes described above.</p>
    <p>We may share data with third-party service providers like Firebase, but only in accordance with their privacy policies. Firebase’s use of data is governed by their own privacy policies, which you can read <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>We may also disclose your information if required by law, such as in response to a court order or governmental request.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us:</p>
